title: Multishot Human Pose
---

I'm trying to extract SMPL parameters on video in a multishot setting. To this end, tracklets are necessary.


### Steps: PHALP setup -> Multishot Human Pose extraction -> select data for training NeRF.


# 1. PHALP setup

### Summary of PHALP
- "Tracking People by Predicting 3D Appearance, Location & Pose" (CVPR 2022)
- Input: monocular video
- Task: Tracking people
- Method
  - lift people in a frame to 3D (3D pose of human, human location in 3D space, 3D appearance)
  - track a person: collect 3D observations over time in a tracklet representation -> build temporal model
    - model predict the future state of a tracklet including 3d location, pose, appearance
    - for the future frame, calculate similarity between pred state of tracklet and single frame observations
  - Association: simple Hungarian matching
- Output: *.pkl file (input for the next step, multishot human pose extraction)
- project page: [PHALP project](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jathushan/PHALP/)

### clone PHALP and install
- follow this [PHALP](https://github.com/brjathu/PHALP#installation)
- it takes quite a time to solve environment in conda...
- "('Connection broken: OSError("(104, \'ECONNRESET\')")', OSError("(104, 'ECONNRESET')"))" error
- I'm using docker container
  - to install git+http, 'apt-get install git'
  - pycocotools error: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72611914/error-could-not-build-wheels-for-pycocotools-which-is-required-to-install-pypr)
- torch.ao is added on 1.10
  

I tried setting an environment without conda, but failed. issues while installing PHALP:
- pip install pyrootutils submitit gdown dill colordict scenedetect pytube
- pip install scikit-learn==0.22.2
- OpenGL: ssh env (without display)
  - install OSMesa [OSMesa doc](https://pyrender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html#installmesa)
  - apt-get install libexpat1-dev
- encountered on PosixPath ~~~ error but I couldn't handle it

### Notes.
- To extract SMPL by multishot human pose, tracking and identification are needed.
- What about the other SMPL algorithms? SMPL extraction models like ROMP, VIBE...
  - Do they use 2D keypoints?
  - Regression or optimized based?
  - How are they inputs like? sequence or only an image? should be cropped? do they work on multiple people?
