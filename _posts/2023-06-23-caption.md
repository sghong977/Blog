How to remove caption from the video data?


## Task
- Goal
  - I want to remove caption area
  - bbox, or non-rectangular mask only for the text area... type doesn't matter but the later one is better
- Issue
  - prefer to use generalized pretrained model
  - without human (without prompt)
  - speed



## How?
### OCR
First of all, optical character recognition would be a nice and trustful approach because it has been a long-lasting computer vision task.
- Scene Text Detection (Localization): to get bbox area of the text in the image
  - e.g., CRAFT [https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch)
- Scene Text Recognition: I don't need this part

### Generalized Segmentation Tools
These days, "Segment Anything" stuffs are trending issue in this field.
- check the performance of SAM for masking text area
- survey on follow-up studies


## Step 1. Let's try SAM
language segment anything [link](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything)

``` Bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install -U git+https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything.git
```

Outputs: masks, boxes, phrases, logits.
