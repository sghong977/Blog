title: Briefly review the code of deep feature 'DISK'
---

Currently I'm stuck into this so I'll take a look at the way how DISK customize their output to COLMAP for the following SfM steps.
How can I custom COLMAP to use the other deep features?



These days, I'm jumping in the deep end to get familiar with COLMAP and basics of multiview geometry.
I'm trying to use deep features (eg. LoFTR) to COLMAP but failed sparse reconstruction. I think it's because of the wrong usage of matches_importer.
And I find that Sitcoms3D do SfM using COLMAP and they also replace the basic SIFT features of colmap into 'DISK' feature.

So, things that I have to do in this step are:
- briefly see the concept of DISK feature algorithm
- input/output
- how to save and load feature in COLMAP
