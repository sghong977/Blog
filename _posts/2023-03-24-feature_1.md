title: Briefly review the code of deep feature 'DISK'
---

How can I custom COLMAP to use the other deep features? Currently I'm stuck into this, so I'll take a look at the way how DISK customize their output to COLMAP for the following SfM steps.




These days, I'm jumping in the deep end to get familiar with COLMAP and basics of multiview geometry.
I'm trying to use deep features (eg. LoFTR) to COLMAP but failed while sparse reconstruction. I think it's because of my wrong usage of matches_importer.
And I find that Sitcoms3D do SfM using COLMAP and they also replace the basic SIFT features of colmap into 'DISK' feature.

So, things that I have to do in this step are:
- [ ] briefly see the concept of DISK feature algorithm
- [ ] input/output
- [x] how to save and load feature in COLMAP
- [ ] try to use DISK official code to check the correct values of colmap db sqlite commands
- [ ] then, insert my custom feature algorithm to colmap db by editing sqlite commands


## Concept of 'DISK' feature algorithm

## Input/output

## How to save and load feature in COLMAP.
See https://github.com/ethanweber/sitcoms3D/tree/master/external/disk.

Step 1. Feature Extraction.
- python detect.py h5_artifacts_destination images_directory
- eg. python **detect.py** --height 1024 --width 1024 --n 2048 scene/h5 scene/images

Step 2. Match Keypoints
- python match.py h5_artifacts_destination
- eg. python **match.py** --rt 0.95 --save-threshold 100 scene/h5

Step 3. Convert to COLMAP *.db file
- features are inserted to db **without descriptor**.
- eg. python colmap/**h5_to_db.py** --database-path scene/database.db scene/h5 scene/images

Step 4. execute colmap cli commands
- **exhaustive_matcher** and **mapper** (sparse reconstruction)

Then, let's check how to convert h5 to db file and insert my custom features like that.

### What kinds of information should be added to *.db file?
h5_to_db.py do this.

- **db.create_tables()**
  - define tables that conpatible to colmap usage
  - by executing 'CREATE_{CAMERAS, IMAGES, KEYPOINTS, DESCRIPTORS, MATCHES, TWO_VIEW_GEOMETRIES, NAME_INDEX}_TABLE' which are defined in colmap/colmap/database.py
- **add_keypoints()**
  - this method() returns 'fname_to_id' (fname_to_id[filename] = image_id)
    - connected to db.add_keypoints(image_id, keypoints) which are defined in colmap/colmap/database.py
  - (optional) create_camera(): add new camera model and intrinsics
- **check_masking(h5_path, mask_path)**
  - this method() returns 'mask_keyp_id' (mask_keyp_id[filename] = keep_inds)
  - read mask files and check if keypoint is valid or not, and keep this information in 'mask_keyp_id'.
- **add_matches(db, h5_path, fname_to_id, mask_keyp_id)**
  - get colmap image ids (id_1, id_2) from fname_to_id
  - it calls the method db.add_matches(id_1, id_2, matches.T[masked_matches]) for image pairs, and add masked matching keypoints
    - matches = group[key_2][()]
    - i think i need to check the value. is it scaled or not, or something else...
    - **my custom feature pairs should fit this form!**
- **db.commit()**: just commit the data to the *.db file

(ing...)
