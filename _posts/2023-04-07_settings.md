Stressful Settings.


# Dependencies
- Detectron2
  - python 3.7 >=
  - torch 1.8 >=
- scikit-learn == 0.22
  - it takes a while to set
  - pip: Cython
  - apt-get: gcc, g++

# Errors
Message: "ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
  - apt-get update && apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y

# Docker

### How to delete \<none\> docker images?
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)   
After I tried this, every <none> dockers are deleted.

# Installation
  
### PHALP  
I failed while using conda yml file because:
- First, I installed conda inside of a docker container to keep experiments going on.
  - when I tried to create conda env, it takes more than an hour to solve dependencies, but it still doesn't finished.
- Then, I tried to install every commands on my own, neural renderer and cuda path problems occurred.
  - It was hard for me to find cuda path in conda env because someone said that each conda environment would only contain the parts of cuda
  - So I should export every paths of cuda related stuff, but when I searched cuda paths in my server computer, there are too many other settings, so I'm not sure what to add
- These are the reasons why I didn't use conda

I use these commands sequentially. After that, demo works well on my docker container.
